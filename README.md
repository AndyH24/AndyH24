## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my projects, most projects I cannot post publicly on GitHub due to academic integrity with Virginia Tech.

- **MyMovieList:** MyMovieList is a full-stack web application designed for movie enthusiasts to create and manage personalized movie lists. In this project, I focused primarily on front-end development, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. The project utilized a variety of technologies including MySQL Workbench for database management, Docker for containerization, and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end development. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in front-end technologies while collaborating with a team to integrate the back-end functionalities seamlessly.
- **Vigenere Cipher Decoder:** The Vigenère Cipher Decoder is a software tool designed to decrypt messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher, a classical method of encryption that employs a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext. This project involved implementing a robust algorithm to reverse the encryption process by accurately identifying the keyword and using it to restore the original message. Through this project, I honed my skills in string manipulation, algorithm design, and cryptographic analysis, ensuring the decoder efficiently handles various ciphertext inputs while maintaining high accuracy and performance.
- **Hierholzer's Algorithm:** This project involved the implementation of Hierholzer's algorithm, a classic graph theory algorithm used to find an Eulerian circuit in a graph. By coding this algorithm, I developed a deep understanding of graph traversal techniques and the specific conditions required for the existence of Eulerian paths and circuits. The project included building a robust software solution that reads graph inputs, processes the data to determine Eulerian properties, and efficiently finds and outputs the Eulerian circuit. This experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced my knowledge of graph algorithms and data structures.
- **Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm Without a Heap:** This project focused on the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph, specifically designed without using a heap data structure. By avoiding a heap, the algorithm maintains simplicity and is easier to understand while still effectively demonstrating the principles of shortest path computation. This implementation required careful management of the priority queue and distance calculations, showcasing my ability to optimize algorithms and handle data structures efficiently. The project not only reinforced my understanding of graph theory but also improved my skills in algorithm design and optimization.
- **Prim's Algorithm:** This project involved the implementation of Prim's algorithm, a fundamental algorithm in graph theory used to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted, undirected graph. The algorithm was coded to efficiently select the minimum weight edges while ensuring the spanning tree remains connected and acyclic. Through this project, I developed a deep understanding of greedy algorithms and their applications in network design and optimization. The implementation highlights my ability to work with complex data structures and optimize algorithmic performance, reinforcing my skills in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.
