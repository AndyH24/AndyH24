## About Me

Hi there! I'm a rising senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. With a passion for coding and problem-solving, I'm on the lookout for a CO-OP opportunity in Spring 2025 and a full-time position post-graduation.

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Java, Python, Ruby
- **Experience:** 
  - 3 years of coding experience
  - Strong backend development skills
  - Some experience with web and mobile development

## Experience

- **Teacher's Assistant** | Virginia Tech, Computer Science Department | Spring 2024

## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my projects, most projects I cannot post due to academic integrity with Virginia Tech.

- **MyMovieList:** MyMovieList is a full-stack web application designed for movie enthusiasts to create and manage personalized movie lists. In this project, I focused primarily on front-end development, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. The project utilized a variety of technologies including MySQL Workbench for database management, Docker for containerization, and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end development. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in front-end technologies while collaborating with a team to integrate the back-end functionalities seamlessly.
- **Linear Cryptanalysis on S-Box:** This project explores the application of linear cryptanalysis techniques on an S-Box, a critical component of many symmetric key encryption algorithms. Through the analysis of linear approximations, the project aims to identify potential weaknesses in the S-Box's cryptographic properties, offering insights into its resistance against linear attacks.
- **Differential Distribution Analysis of S-Box:** Project 2 investigates the differential distribution properties of an S-Box, a fundamental building block in cryptographic systems. By analyzing the frequency of output differences for various input differences, the project aims to assess the resilience of the S-Box against differential cryptanalysis attacks. Insights gained from this analysis can aid in evaluating the overall security of the cryptographic algorithm employing the S-Box.
- **Vigenere Cipher Decoder:** The Vigenère Cipher Decoder is a software tool designed to decrypt messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher, a classical method of encryption that employs a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext. This project involved implementing a robust algorithm to reverse the encryption process by accurately identifying the keyword and using it to restore the original message. Through this project, I honed my skills in string manipulation, algorithm design, and cryptographic analysis, ensuring the decoder efficiently handles various ciphertext inputs while maintaining high accuracy and performance.
